## Acrobammer

The successor to the Acrobot is here: the Acrobammer. Acrobot is a self-balancing robot project from Penn's graduate-level mechatronics course, MEAM510.

### What makes it different??

* Acrobammer is harder: Arm Cortex-M4 + BLDC motors
* Acrobammer is better: 1 meter tall
* Acrobammer is faster: 5 m/s
* Acrobammer is stronger: 15 kg

It's a sledgehammer. Specifically, it's the biggest sledgehammer sold by Hoffmann Group, our local industrial tool supplier. To go larger, you'd need a ridiculous Crossfit hammer or the epic, oversized Big Ass Mallet from Mahler's Symphony No. 6.

This is based on an idea by CMU professor Ralph Hollis: putting the weight as high as possible makes it easier to move the wheels on a mobile inverted pendulum. This is also based on an idea by Gunner Tagliabue: a loud boom is satisfying.
